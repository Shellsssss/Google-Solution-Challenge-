## The Problem

- 🇮🇳 **77,000** new oral cancer cases/year in India; **52,000** deaths
- **74.9%** of cases come from rural areas with no specialist access
- **80%** are diagnosed at Stage 3 or 4 — when survival rates drop below 30%
- Oral cancer accounts for **30%** of all cancers in India *(ICMR NCRP, GLOBOCAN 2021)*

## Our Solution

JanArogya puts a cancer screening tool in the hands of ASHA workers and patients via:
1. **WhatsApp Bot** — send a photo, get a risk assessment in seconds (no app install needed)
2. **Android App** — full offline-capable screening + PDF report generation
3. **AI Model** — TFLite model for on-device oral lesion detection
